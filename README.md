ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-podcast-generator.git
cd ai-podcast-generator

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a .env file
In the project root, create a .env file with the following content:

uvicorn main_api:app --reload
Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
This opens Swagger UI where you can test the API.

In Swagger UI, go to the POST /generate_podcast endpoint.

Click "Try it out".

Fill in the JSON fields. For example:

{
  "topic": "The rise of AI in education"
}

The API will return a response like:
{
  "success": true,

}
The script and audio files will be saved in your working directory.
